Communication is one of the basic requirement of survival and great way of expresssing oneself.Deaf and mute people find it difficult to communicate with normal people.Communicating with normal people has always been barrier for them.They find it difficult to express their thoughts or convey a messange speciallyin public places or business places where they become anxious and nervous.Sign language would bridge this gap,but learning sign language is also a difficult process and it is not taught in schools or colleges.An effective approach that would make this work more easier and time saving which translates a sign into text.
